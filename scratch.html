	<h1> Scratch </h1>
		<p>
		<h2> Name Assignment</h2>
			<img src="images/name project screenshot.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
			I used scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to have a sprite for each letter of my name and have them all have 3 unique behavior that started when the green flag was pressed. For extra credit, if u press the spacebar it will reset.
		<h3> Concepts Learned</h3> 
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks (when green flag is clicked, when key is pressed…)</li>
			<li>Conditional statements ( if/then statements) </li>
			<li>Used loops ( forever block/repeat block)</li>
			<li>Sprites (created my own sprites with sprite editor, chose from the library of sprites, changed costumes)</li>
			<li>Movement (used x and y values to make sprites move to certain locations, rotated sprites)</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2> Computer Buying Project </h2>
			<img src="images/computer buying project screenshot.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
			I worked with other people to compare different computers. We researched different brands and their qualities and presented it in a scratch movie. On scratch we programed different characters to go through the computer buying experience where the “customer” decided on the best computer.
		<h3> Concepts Learned</h3> 
		<ul>
			<li>Different computer qualities </li>
			<li>Using event blocks (when green flag is clicked, when key is pressed…) </li>
			<li>Sprites (created my own sprites with sprite editor, chose from the library of sprites, changed costumes)</li>
			<li>Movement (used x and y values to make sprites move to certain locations, rotated sprites)</li>
			<li>Say blocks (to make lines of script)</li>
			<li>Wait blocks (make characters speak at different times)</li>
			<li>Hide/Show blocks (to make sprites disappear and reappear) <.li>
			<li>Background changes </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Final Project </h2>
			<img src="images/final scratch screenshot.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
				I had to program an interactive game using scratch where the user would bounce a ball and break out pieces. Once all of the pieces were broken the second level began, and once those were gone, the game would end. There had to be a timer, counter and a help button for how to play the game.
		<h3> Concepts Learned</h3>

			<li>Sprites (created my own sprites with sprite editor, chose from the library of sprites, changed costumes)</li>

			<li>Say blocks (to make lines of script)</li>
			<li>Hide/Show blocks (to make sprites disappear and reappear) <.li>
			<li>Conditional statements ( if/then statements  if a sprite touched another it would disappear, bounce, etc)</li>
			<li>Used loops ( forever block/repeat block for constant movement, players ball always bounces off of the edges of the screen) </li>
		</ul>
